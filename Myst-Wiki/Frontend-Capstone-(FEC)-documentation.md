## Concepts
* React Router DOM
* React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, createContext)
* Client Side Rendering
* App Level State Management (React Context API)

## Goals
* Decide on an application to clone
* Build a clone of the application
* Function based components
* "Products inventory" page => "Product detail" page (in full)
* Emphasis of the Product detail page (minimum requirement)
* Small backend just to seed enough data to be available to the front end
* Schema for entity relational database

## General Guidelines
* Scrum meetings at least once per day (standup)
* Update the Kanban board every couple of hours (or more often if you like)
* Commit often, with good inline comments
* Naming convention for branches
* - main
* - develop
* - 'your name'
* - 'feature/name-of-the-feature'
* At the first sign of significant problems, alert the team
* - Call an impromptu Scrum
* - Make sure everyone is aware of the issue/issues
* - Make common sense calls when it comes to the develop branch
